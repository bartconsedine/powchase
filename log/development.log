There is something at work in my soul which I do not understand. I am practically industrious—painstaking, a workman to execute with perseverance and labour—but besides this there is a love for the marvellous, a belief in the marvellous, intertwined in all my projects, which hurries me out of the common pathways of men, even to the wild sea and unvisited regions I am about to explore."], ["created_at", "2019-11-09 14:40:21.311597"], ["updated_at", "2019-11-09 14:40:21.311597"]]
